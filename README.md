# optimal-quadratic-averaging
A Matlab implementation of the optimal quadratic averaging algorithm.
The accompanying paper can be found at (http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06543).

## File descriptions:

```main.m``` contains examples of using ```optave.m```, a Matlab implementation of the optimal quadratic averaging algorithm.
The comments at the beginning of ```optave.m``` describe the function in detail.

```memory_comparison_plot.m``` produces a plot that shows the advantage of using memory in ```optave.m```.
